## GWAS summary statistics used:

In this study we explored the genetic association between insulin sensitivity and insulin resistance (exposures) and birthweight (outcome). We performed four analysis that can be divided into two groups depending on the type of data that we utilized:

a) analysis that use selected instrumented variants: genetic risk scores (GRS) and common mendelian randomization analysis with 2SMR package.
b) analysis that use all genome-wide association studies: genetic correlations with High Definition Likelihood (HDL) and Linkage Disequilibrium Score (LDSC) and CAUSE MR package.

For each exposure we will here report which data we used in each analysis:

### Exposure: insulin sensitivity
### Exposure: insulin resistance
### Outcome: birthweight 

For birthweight we used 5 traits coming from 2 different sources.

We used 3 unadjusted traits from Juliusdottir et al:

a) fetal effect on birthweight (EGG+UKBB+Icelandic GWAS meta-analysis)
b) maternal effects on birthweight (EGG+UKBB+Icelandic GWAS meta-analysis)
c) paternal effects on birthweight (only Icelandic GWAS available)

Additionally, we used 2 adjusted traits from Warrington et al to disentangle the associations that are driven by the fetus' or by the mother's genetics

a) fetal effects adjusted for maternal genotype
b) maternal effects adjsted for fetal genotype
