0  SNPs were removed in GWAS 1 due to missing N or missing test statistic.  
0  SNPs were removed in GWAS 2 due to missing N or missing test statistic.  
769174 out of 769306 (99.98%) SNPs in reference panel are available in GWAS 1.  
768764 out of 769306 (99.93%) SNPs in reference panel are available in GWAS 2.

Heritability of phenotype 1:  0.00e+00 (0.00e+00) 
Heritability of phenotype 2:  0.0664 (0.0034) 
Genetic Covariance:  0.0202 (0.0111) 
Genetic Correlation:  Inf (NA) 
P:  NA 
Warning: Heritability of one trait was estimated to be 0, which may due to:
            1) The true heritability is very low;
            2) The sample size of the GWAS is too small;
            3) Many SNPs in the chosen reference panel are absent in the GWAS;
            4) There is a severe mismatch between the GWAS population and the population for computing reference panel
