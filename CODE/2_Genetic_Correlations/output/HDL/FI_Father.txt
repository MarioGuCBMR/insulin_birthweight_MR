0  SNPs were removed in GWAS 1 due to missing N or missing test statistic.  
0  SNPs were removed in GWAS 2 due to missing N or missing test statistic.  
769306 out of 769306 (100%) SNPs in reference panel are available in GWAS 1.  
760259 out of 769306 (98.82%) SNPs in reference panel are available in GWAS 2.  
Warning: More than 1% SNPs in reference panel are missed in GWAS 2. This may generate bias in estimation. Please make sure that you are using correct reference panel.
